            "description": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing websites to improve visibility in organic search results. It involves on-page optimization (content, keywords, meta tags), technical SEO (site speed, structure, indexing), and off-page optimization (backlinks, citations). Google's algorithm evaluates hundreds of factors to rank pages, aiming to deliver the most relevant results for user queries."

            "description": "Organic results are unpaid listings earned through SEO efforts. Paid results are advertisements you bid on using keywords (Google Ads). Paid appears at the top of SERPs with an 'Ad' label; organic appears below. Paid requires budgets and bid management; organic requires keyword optimization and content quality. Organic has higher click-through rates and trust."

            "description": "SEO typically takes 3-6 months to show significant results, depending on competition, website age, and content quality. High-competition keywords may take 6-12 months or longer. Local SEO shows faster results (1-3 months). Consistency, quality content, and technical optimization matter more than speed. Google's indexing and ranking processes take time."

            "description": "Keywords are search terms users type into Google. Find them by: checking SERP 'People Also Ask' sections, using tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Ubersuggest, analyzing competitor websites, studying user intent, examining Google Search Console data, and researching long-tail variations. Focus on keywords with moderate search volume and lower difficulty for quick wins."

            "description": "On-page SEO: Content quality, meta tags, keyword optimization, internal links, page speed, user experience, headers, and schema markup. Off-page SEO: Backlinks, citations, domain authority, social signals, brand mentions, and external validation. Both are essential—on-page ensures relevance; off-page builds authority."

            "description": "Google uses page speed as a ranking factor. Fast-loading sites improve user experience, reduce bounce rates, and enable better crawling of content. Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) are official ranking signals. Page speed affects mobile rankings more than desktop. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and GTmetrix to identify bottlenecks and optimize."

            "description": "A backlink is a hyperlink from another website pointing to your site. Backlinks signal trust and authority to search engines. High-quality backlinks from authoritative, relevant sites boost rankings more than quantity. Natural, editorial backlinks are most valuable. Focus on earning links through quality content, not buying them, which violates Google's guidelines."

            "description": "Domain Authority (by Moz) and Domain Rating (by Ahrefs) are metrics measuring a website's authority and ranking potential on a 0-100 scale. Higher scores suggest better ranking potential. They're influenced by backlink quality, quantity, and domain age. DA/DR are correlation metrics, not direct ranking factors, but strong indicators of SEO strength."

            "description": "Keyword stemming is Google's ability to recognize variations of a word (plurals, tenses, prefixes, suffixes) in search queries. For example, 'run', 'runs', 'running', 'runner' are recognized as related terms. This means ranking for 'running' helps you rank for 'run'. LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords enhance this effect by providing semantic variations."

            "description": "Bounce rate is the % of visitors leaving after viewing only one page. Improve it by: enhancing content quality and relevance, improving site speed and UX design, adding clear CTAs, creating better internal links, optimizing for mobile, reducing pop-ups, improving page loading, and ensuring landing page matches search intent. A lower bounce rate improves rankings and user satisfaction."

It confirms your site can be crawled, identifies indexing issues, monitors search traffic, shows which keywords bring traffic, reports mobile usability, and alerts you to technical problems. It's essential for understanding how Google sees your site and fixing issues that impact rankings."

Voice searches are longer and more specific than text searches."

It enables rich snippets (enhanced listings with ratings, prices, dates) in search results, improving click-through rates. Schema increases visibility and can boost rankings. Common schemas: Product, Article, LocalBusiness, FAQ, Review. Use JSON-LD format in HTML head."
